# Instavar SG Narration LoRA R8

Derived from Breeze TTS 2 by BreezeBlue and licensed for research and
non-commercial use only.

This is an independent research adapter trained by Instavar on a consented,
single-speaker subset of Singapore's National Speech Corpus. It is not an
official BreezeBlue release and is not endorsed by BreezeBlue or RESONIA, INC.

## Artifact

- Base: `BreezeBlue/Breeze-TTS-2`
- Pinned base revision: `799624c0b4a1daa8db6d28bbd9850043c0270734`
- Adapter: rank 8, alpha 16
- Selected checkpoint: step 500 of 1,000
- Trainable parameters: 12,092,448
- Adapted families: semantic backbone, depth decoder, text projection,
  depth-input projection, and output projection

The adapter manifest pins the base revision and checksums. The loader refuses a
revision or file mismatch.

## Use

Use the companion source toolkit:

```powershell
.\scripts\run_inference.ps1 `
  -ModelRoot 'D:\models\Breeze-TTS-2' `
  -Adapter 'D:\models\sg-narration-lora-r8' `
  -Text 'The train arrives in five minutes.' `
  -Output 'output.wav' `
  --base-revision '799624c0b4a1daa8db6d28bbd9850043c0270734'
```

## Evaluation

In a matched reference-free comparison, this adapter reached mean ECAPA speaker
similarity 0.6810 and WER 0.0467. The selected full-SFT checkpoint reached 0.6973
and the same WER. The paired ECAPA interval crossed zero, so the objective study
did not establish a winner.

One listener preferred this adapter for cadence and long-form listening, with
three short-prompt ties. Both releases mispronounced a tested local word. These
results do not establish faithful identity cloning, general Singaporean-accent
coverage, production fitness, or broad listener preference.

## Licence and responsible use

The included BreezeBlue agreement permits research and non-commercial use only.
Do not use this artifact for a product, paid service, client work, advertising,
revenue generation, production deployment, impersonation, deception, or voice
cloning without legally sufficient consent and recording rights.

Review `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `PROVENANCE.json`, and `SHA256SUMS` before use.
